# Boilerplate

The idea behind a boilerplate for a web applications, is that it can save a lot of valuable time from setting up a new work environment every time. In this one you will find the following technologies:

 * __Expess__ and __express-handlebars__
 * Middleware: __body-parser__
 * Testing with __tape, supertest, tap-spec and nyc__
 * __Postgress__ database using the __pg-promise module__
 * __Nodemon__ for running the server locally

***

To run the project locally you need to do the following:
* Clone the repository
* Cd into it
* Run the command: npm i, in your terminal
* Run the command: npm run devStart
* Open localhost:4001 in your browser
